# âœ… DSA Arrays â€“ Topic-wise Summary
# Introduction to Arrays:
Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

# Syntax & Accessing Elements:
Declaration: int arr[5];
Access via index: arr[0], arr[1], ..., up to arr[n-1].

# Printing Output & Taking Input:
Use loops (for or while) to take input and display elements:
cin >> arr[i]; and cout << arr[i];.

# Types of Arrays:
Mainly 1D, 2D, and multidimensional arrays; today focused on 1D arrays.

# Size Operator (sizeof):
sizeof(arr) gives total memory size.
sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]) gives total number of elements.

# Memory Allocation & Address of Elements:
Arrays are stored in contiguous memory.
You can access memory addresses using &arr[i].

# Linear Search:
Traverse each element one by one to find the target value.
Time Complexity: O(n).

# ğŸ§  Basic Problems (WAP Summaries)
1. Marks Less than 30:
Loop through array and print values < 30.

2. Linear Search (Code):
Search for a key by comparing each element.

3. Max Element:
Initialize with arr[0], compare each element to find the largest.

4. Second Max Element:
Track both max and secondMax by iterating once.

5. Count Greater than Key:
Take a key input and count how many elements are greater.

6. Sum of All Elements:
Initialize sum as 0 and keep adding all elements using a loop.
